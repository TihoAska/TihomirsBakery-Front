                    <p>
                        A meal that tastes just like pizza, but is a lot healthier. Butter plays a key role here, so use it instead of oil.
                        Origano and ketchup give you that pizza taste, just don't overdo it with cheese. <br><br> <span style="color: orange;">INGREDIENTS: 
                        butter, eggs, cheese, origano, mushrooms.</span>

                        So many variations of this meal can be made. Main ingredients are oats and whey protein. 
                        Fruit can be of your choice, but my picks are banana or kiwi. <br><br> <span style="color: orange;">INGREDIENTS:

                        If your oatmeal is hard to eat, you can just blend it and drink it. Blending stuff makes it easy to get your calories
                        in if you don't feel like eating. You can also put some coffee in it.<br><br> <span style="color: orange;">INGREDIENTS:

                    <p>
                        If you're in a hurry, just mix some whey protein with water and grab any fruit you like. You'll get the protein and nutrients
                        for the morning, but you will be hungry soon, so make sure you pack yourself one of the meals mentioned before.
