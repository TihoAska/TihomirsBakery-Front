                            A light meal full of protein and healthy fats. You can never go wrong with eggs, you can make them in various combinations
                            and eat them every day.

                            If you don't like fish, you can try it with pasta and it will taste much better. If you're eating canned fish, make sure
                            you get rid of the oil.

                            Similar to the meal above, eating fish in a different way can change the taste. I sometimes put sardines on a toast with 
                            cottage cheese. If you're eating canned sardines, make sure you get rid of the oil.

                            A meal that I used to eat when I was a kid. I just replaced cocoa with whey protein. Make sure you don't add any sugar.
