                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            A quick meal that you can pack and eat at scool or an office. Pay attention to the ingredients, make sure 
                            they are of good quality.<br><br> <span style="color: orange;">INGREDIENTS:

                        <h3>BANANA RICE CAKES</h3>
                        <hr>
                        <p>
                            A great meal to have instead of your usual sweets. Rice cakes are a great choice because they are 100% rice.
                            Make sure the peanut butter is of a good quality.
                            <br><br> <span style="color: orange;">INGREDIENTS:

                        <p>
                            Great meal to get your nutrients and vitamins in. You can pick any fruit you want, but I always put banana, kiwi and an apple.
                            Pour some honey over it if it's too sour for you.<br><br> <span style="color: orange;">INGREDIENTS:

                        <p>
                            If you're in a hurry, just mix some whey protein with water and grab any fruit you like. You'll get the protein and nutrients
                            for the morning, but you will be hungry soon, so make sure you pack yourself one of the meals mentioned before.
