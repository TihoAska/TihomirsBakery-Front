                <p>
                    They say what squats are for legs, dips are for triceps. One of the best upper body exercises, alongside pullups, that you can do.
                    This is a <span>MUST DO</span> exercise.

                <p>
                    Find bars that are not too wide or too narrow, tighten your core, put your legs in front of you, bend over a bit and never change your form during the exercise.
                    Your body has to stay tight at all times.

                <p>
                    Harder variation of dips. This variation puts more stress on your shoulders and triceps. Since your front shoulder and triceps are working
                    in every pushing exercise, you should stick to regular dips, since they target more of your chest muscles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grab a bar a bit wider than your sholder length, tighten your core, put your legs in front, bend over a bit and stay stable during the exercise.
