                        Gym chalk provides additional grip. It's great for doing pullups when bars are slippery. You can also use it for heavy lifts like deadlifts 
                        but straps are better for that. If you get blisters gloves are a better option.

                        When doing heavy lifts, your hands can't hold the weights anymore. These straps help you hold the weight, but your forearms and 
                        arm muscles aren't working that much anymore. Use them only when weight is too heavy.

                        Chain belt helps you add more weight to your bodyweight exercises. If you can do a lot of pullups and dips you can add more weight
                        to increase your strength.

                        Gym gloves provide more grip, a bit less than chalk, but prevent blisters. You can use them for every lift, but you won't feel
                        the bar as good as bare handed.

                        Gym belt helps you stabilize and engage your core. If you're doing heavy lifts you put a lot of pressure on your lower back and core.
                        Wearing a belt will help you lift more weight and prevent hernias in your back and core.

                    <p>
                        Resistance bands can help you in various ways. They can help you learn pullups and muscle-ups, engage your muscles during a warmup
                        and even replace your dumbbels. The resistance is variable so depending on where you grab it you will get that much tension.
